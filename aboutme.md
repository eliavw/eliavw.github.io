Ph.D. student in the DTAI Research Lab at KU Leuven, where I conduct my research under the supervision of prof. Hendrik Blockeel.

My main focus is in the area of ensemble methods, and particularly in developing novel methods with an emphasis on _flexibility_. For instance, our MERCS-framework does not presuppose a predefined prediction task.
